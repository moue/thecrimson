    text: "On July 17th, citing \"lack of reader interest\", and \"being really lame\
      \ and unfunny\", the president of the Harvard Lampoon announced that the Lampoon\
      \ would be disbanded.  Dan Caroll '09 summarized the consensus reaction of Harvard's\
      \ student body, asking \"the Harvard what?\"\n\nIdentify one of the important\
      \ long-term patterns, problems or themes which Fairbank perceives in the great\
      \ span of Chinese history. How does this pattern, problem or theme shape events\
      \ in the 19th and 20th centuries? In regard to your chosen theme, what remains\
      \ constant and what changes as China enters into \u201Cmodern\u201D history?\
      \ When does this transition take place? If possible, include reference to the\
      \ articles on Taiwan (for frontier concerns, imperialist competition, etc.).\n\
      \n\nOf the many long term trends in Chinese history Fairbanks identifies is\
      \ the traditional dislike of the military aspect of government - wu.  Rooted\
      \ in a Confucian philosophy that put wen - the civil side of government, above\
      \ wu - the martial side of government, Chinese dynasties have invested heavily\
      \ in scholarship, but very little in the military.  In early Chinese history,\
      \ this meant that the military class was excluded from civil society, going\
      \ so far as to be not included in the list of Confucius's four basic classes\
      \ of society.  \n\nMilitary service, with its inherent penchant for violence,\
      \ was criticized as barbaric, below a civilized society.  Confucians believed\
      \ that wen would always prevail over wu, justifying their paltry investments\
      \ into defense.  As a result, to fend off barbarians, Chinese imperial dynasties\
      \ developed a tribute system, paying neighboring barbarians to not raid China.\
      \  This however, fell apart when dynasties, and therefore, tax collection, fell\
      \ apart, and China was conquered on two occasions by barbarians to the north\
      \ - first by the Mongols and later by the Manchurians.  The Manchurians of the\
      \ Qing dynasty managed the military side of government, while they used Chinese\
      \ intellectuals and scholars to manage the civil side of government.  \n\nUnfortunately,\
      \ with Qing rule coming to a close and Chinese culture subsuming Manchu culture\
      \ in the upper echelons of government, China's loses major wars to foreign powers.\
      \  The reason for these losses was not simply technological gaps.  More importantly,\
      \ bureaucratic ineptitude and a low investment in the nation's military caused\
      \ Western powers to repeatedly defeat and dominate China.  Beyond low fiscal\
      \ investments, Chinese perceptions of the unimportance of the military led to\
      \ little effort in organizing a strong military.  During many attacks on Chinese\
      \ soil, the central government relied on regional and provincial governors to\
      \ combat approaching gun-ships - it was as if a country invaded the United States\
      \ through Michigan, and the United States Federal Government placed the burden\
      \ of defense not on the US Armed Forces, but on hunters groups living in Michigan!\
      \  \n\nAs a result of downplaying the importance of the military and losing\
      \ wars to foreign powers, China was under foreign oppression for over a hundred\
      \ years while it failed to modernize.\nThis weakness very suddenly took a one\
      \ hundred and eighty degree turn in the 19th century, where a period of warlordism\
      \ was followed by periods of military fascism, militarist nationalism, and a\
      \ a militarist communism.  Suddenly, governments abandoned their Neo-Confucian\
      \ ideals and devoted more and more energy to cultivating the wu of their governments.\
      \ \n\n Because this weakness was very apparent to many Chinese of the 19th and\
      \ 20th centuries, and it was probably against the background of China's historical\
      \ military weaknesses that the warlords, nationalists, and communists organized\
      \ themselves.  Because of China's historic lack of military power, the easiest\
      \ way to take power in China was by force, and both the nationalists and communists\
      \ used just these methods to ascend to power.  These factors directly contributed\
      \ to China's current governmental models centered around the military.  Not\
      \ wanting to repeat China's past mistakes, her current governors overcompensate,\
      \ devoting extra resources to areas that used to cause China's weakness.\n"

    text: "This week\u2019s readings focus on the variety of political and cultural\

      \ of the Nationalist government, the seizure of Manchuria by Japan, and the\
      \ invasion and occupation of 1937? Why did some ideologies (such as liberalism)\
      \ die out so quickly while others (namely nationalism and socialism) remain\
      \ popular for such a long time? In what ways were the policies, goals and methods\
      \ of the Nationalists and the Communists similar and how did they differ? \n\
      \nHow did people in different social groups and different parts of the old Qing\
      \ Empire envision themselves, their country, and their future? How did different\
      \ people\u2019s self-identity change over time? How did what it meant to be\
      \ Chinese or Taiwanese change from the turn of the century to 1949? \n\nIn preparing\
      \ for section discussions, consider the three sets of questions and scenarios\
      \ below. For the 1-2 page response paper, please focus on one of these. Please\
      \ e-mail your response paper to your section leader by 5:00 pm the day before\
      \ your section meets. \n\n1) Imagine that you are a student in China in the\
      \ 1930s. The Guomindang (Kuomintang - Nationalist Party in English) has formed\
      \ a government and is actively recruiting talented and educated people like\
      \ yourself. You have also been contacted by members of the underground Communist\
      \ Party organization, who would like you to work for them and the revolution.\
      \ Which would you choose and why? \n\n2) Looking at the characters presented\
      \ in the stories \u201CThe Steelyard,\u201D \u201CThe Doctor\u2019s Mother,\u201D\
      \ \u201CAutumn Note\u201D and \u201CLunar New Year\u2019s Feast,\u201D how did\
      \ Taiwanese identity evolve from 1895 to 1949? To what extent was this identity\
      \ dependent on one\u2019s generation or social status? Imagine that you were\
      \ living in Taiwan in the 1920s? How would you have understood \u201CChina\u201D\
      \ and \u201CJapan\u201D in this context? How would you have envisioned yourself\
      \ \u2013 as Chinese? As a subject of the Qing Empire or the Japanese Empire?\
      \ As someone uniquely Taiwanese? How would your age or social status have affected\
      \ your identity and worldview? Address these questions with specific reference\
      \ to the characters presented in these stories. \n\n3) Imagine that your parents\
      \ are engineers and members of the Guomindang (Kuomintang) in 1949. You have\
      \ two siblings, and all three of you are well educated. The Communists want\
      \ your family to stay to work for the new \u201CPeople\u2019s China.\u201D The\
      \ Nationalist government wants you to move to Taiwan. Your family also has connections\
      \ in San Francisco, and emigration to the U.S. is an option. What does your\
      \ family do? How would this scenario be different if your family owned and operated\
      \ several silk factories in Shanghai and Hong Kong? \n\nAssignment 3\n\n3. I\
      \ would probably advise my family to work for the Communists on the mainland\
      \ for a few reasons, specifically, nationalism and high pay.  While on face\
      \ value moving to the United States may seem like a good idea, with its increased\
      \ opportunities for jobs and growth, a few factors bar this from being the best\
      \ move.  First of all, discrimination against Asian Americans in the United\
      \ States is relatively prevalent, evidenced by the Chinese Exclusion Act only\
      \ recently being repealed. Second, cultural barriers would probably prevent\
      \ my family from settling successfully.  Although it isn't impossible, my family\
      \ would have a much easier life in a country they are familiar with, rather\
      \ than move to an entirely new place and have to cope with the culture shock\
      \ of America.\n\nBesides comparative benefits, working as an engineer has positive\
      \ results as well, especially nationalism.  The Communists, which have control\
      \ of all of China, are promising to rebuild and modernize China, and working\
      \ for them would mean that my family gets to contribute to making China great\
      \ again, something that would be very unlikely with the Guomindang, given its\
      \ inability to control territory on the mainland.  Working with the Communist\
      \ government, would be, in effect, working for the Chinese people to bring out\
      \ country into the modern era.  Engineers are very important for building China's\
      \ infrastructure, and without engineers, it would be impossible to build the\
      \ roads, factories, and mines necessary for China's industrialization.  This\
      \ industrialization will be critical to building up both China's economy and\
      \ China's military.  These factors are critical to make China an important actor\
      \ in the international arena.  Without engineers like those in my family, China\
      \ will not be able to compete with nations like Japan and the United States\
      \ in the future, which will only cause more imperialism, suffering and shame\
      \ within China.  \n\nFinancial compensation with the Communist party would also\
      \ be greater than it would with the Guomindang.  With Communist control of the\
      \ tax base, they have much more money to spend than the Guomindang, and can\
      \ afford to pay more.  Furthermore, since engineers are so important to the\
      \ government, the Communists are paying very high salaries to engineers working\
      \ for the party.  Engineering jobs within the Communist Party also offer many\
      \ opportunities to advance in position.  Many new higher positions are being\
      \ taken up by engineers advising the Communists about how to proceed with their\
      \ extensive industrializing and modernizing processes.  \n\nThis situation would\
      \ be different if we owned large silk factories.  Since the Communists have\
      \ nationalized many of the industries, including silk factories, which would\
      \ reduce much of the family's wealth.  Without this source of wealth, it would\
      \ probably be better to work either in the United States, or in Taiwan.  \n\n"
