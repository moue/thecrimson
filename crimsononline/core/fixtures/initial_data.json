Dan Caroll '09 summarized the consensus reaction of Harvard's student body, asking \"the Harvard what?\"\n\nIdentify one of the important long-term patterns, problems or themes which Fairbank perceives in the great span of Chinese history. How does this pattern, problem or theme shape events in the 19th and 20th centuries? In regard to your chosen theme, what remains constant and what changes as China enters into \u201cmodern\u201d history? When does this transition take place? If possible, include reference to the articles on Taiwan (for frontier concerns, imperialist competition, etc.).\n\n\nOf the many long term trends in Chinese history Fairbanks identifies is the traditional dislike of the military aspect of government - wu.  Rooted in a Confucian philosophy that put wen - the civil side of government, above wu - the martial side of government, Chinese dynasties have invested heavily in scholarship, but very little in the military.  In early Chinese history, this meant that the military class was excluded from civil society, going so far as to be not included in the list of Confucius's four basic classes of society.  \n\nMilitary service, with its inherent penchant for violence, was criticized as barbaric, below a civilized society.  Confucians believed that wen would always prevail over wu, justifying their paltry investments into defense.  As a result, to fend off barbarians, Chinese imperial dynasties developed a tribute system, paying neighboring barbarians to not raid China.  This however, fell apart when dynasties, and therefore, tax collection, fell apart, and China was conquered on two occasions by barbarians to the north - first by the Mongols and later by the Manchurians.  The Manchurians of the Qing dynasty managed the military side of government, while they used Chinese intellectuals and scholars to manage the civil side of government.  \n\nUnfortunately, with Qing rule coming to a close and Chinese culture subsuming Manchu culture in the upper echelons of government, China's loses major wars to foreign powers.  The reason for these losses was not simply technological gaps.  More importantly, bureaucratic ineptitude and a low investment in the nation's military caused Western powers to repeatedly defeat and dominate China.  Beyond low fiscal investments, Chinese perceptions of the unimportance of the military led to little effort in organizing a strong military.  During many attacks on Chinese soil, the central government relied on regional and provincial governors to combat approaching gun-ships - it was as if a country invaded the United States through Michigan, and the United States Federal Government placed the burden of defense not on the US Armed Forces, but on hunters groups living in Michigan!  \n\nAs a result of downplaying the importance of the military and losing wars to foreign powers, China was under foreign oppression for over a hundred years while it failed to modernize.\nThis weakness very suddenly took a one hundred and eighty degree turn in the 19th century, where a period of warlordism was followed by periods of military fascism, militarist nationalism, and a a militarist communism.  Suddenly, governments abandoned their Neo-Confucian ideals and devoted more and more energy to cultivating the wu of their governments. \n\n Because this weakness was very apparent to many Chinese of the 19th and 20th centuries, and it was probably against the background of China's historical military weaknesses that the warlords, nationalists, and communists organized themselves.  Because of China's historic lack of military power, the easiest way to take power in China was by force, and both the nationalists and communists used just these methods to ascend to power.  These factors directly contributed to China's current governmental models centered around the military.  Not wanting to repeat China's past mistakes, her current governors overcompensate, devoting extra resources to areas that used to cause China's weakness.\n", "section": 4, "uploaded_on": "2008-07-19 20:37:37", "page": "", "priority": 80, "subheadline": "", "teaser": "On July 17th, citing \"lack of reader interest\", and \"being really lame and unfunny\", the president of the Harvard Lampoon announced that the Lampoon would be disbanded.", "sne": 1, "proofer": 1, "modified_on": "2008-07-19 20:37:37", "web_only": false, "issue": 1, "slug": "The-Harvard-Lampoon-Announces-its-Closure", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "core.article", "fields": {"byline_type": "cstaff", "image_gallery": null, "contributors": [2, 3], "tags": [2, 5, 6, 7], "headline": "Drew Faust Responds To Criticism", "text": "This week\u2019s readings focus on the variety of political and cultural options available to different groups of Chinese (defined by social status, access to political power, and region) after the fall of the Qing Dynasty. In addition to the history textbook, there is a scholarly article on China\u2019s \u201cdevelopmental state\u201d under the Nationalist Party, two pieces by early Chinese Communists, and five short stories, one about Shanghai in the 1920s and four about Taiwan during and immediately after the period of Japanese colonization. \n\nHow did China\u2019s leaders (or potential leaders) envision China\u2019s problems and possible solutions? What alternative ideologies were available at the time? How did these ideologies evolve between 1911 and 1949 in response to the collapse of the first republic, the establishment of the Nationalist government, the seizure of Manchuria by Japan, and the invasion and occupation of 1937? Why did some ideologies (such as liberalism) die out so quickly while others (namely nationalism and socialism) remain popular for such a long time? In what ways were the policies, goals and methods of the Nationalists and the Communists similar and how did they differ? \n\nHow did people in different social groups and different parts of the old Qing Empire envision themselves, their country, and their future? How did different people\u2019s self-identity change over time? How did what it meant to be Chinese or Taiwanese change from the turn of the century to 1949? \n\nIn preparing for section discussions, consider the three sets of questions and scenarios below. For the 1-2 page response paper, please focus on one of these. Please e-mail your response paper to your section leader by 5:00 pm the day before your section meets. \n\n1) Imagine that you are a student in China in the 1930s. The Guomindang (Kuomintang - Nationalist Party in English) has formed a government and is actively recruiting talented and educated people like yourself. You have also been contacted by members of the underground Communist Party organization, who would like you to work for them and the revolution. Which would you choose and why? \n\n2) Looking at the characters presented in the stories \u201cThe Steelyard,\u201d \u201cThe Doctor\u2019s Mother,\u201d \u201cAutumn Note\u201d and \u201cLunar New Year\u2019s Feast,\u201d how did Taiwanese identity evolve from 1895 to 1949? To what extent was this identity dependent on one\u2019s generation or social status? Imagine that you were living in Taiwan in the 1920s? How would you have understood \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cJapan\u201d in this context? How would you have envisioned yourself \u2013 as Chinese? As a subject of the Qing Empire or the Japanese Empire? As someone uniquely Taiwanese? How would your age or social status have affected your identity and worldview? Address these questions with specific reference to the characters presented in these stories. \n\n3) Imagine that your parents are engineers and members of the Guomindang (Kuomintang) in 1949. You have two siblings, and all three of you are well educated. The Communists want your family to stay to work for the new \u201cPeople\u2019s China.\u201d The Nationalist government wants you to move to Taiwan. Your family also has connections in San Francisco, and emigration to the U.S. is an option. What does your family do? How would this scenario be different if your family owned and operated several silk factories in Shanghai and Hong Kong? \n\nAssignment 3\n\n3. I would probably advise my family to work for the Communists on the mainland for a few reasons, specifically, nationalism and high pay.  While on face value moving to the United States may seem like a good idea, with its increased opportunities for jobs and growth, a few factors bar this from being the best move.  First of all, discrimination against Asian Americans in the United States is relatively prevalent, evidenced by the Chinese Exclusion Act only recently being repealed. Second, cultural barriers would probably prevent my family from settling successfully.  Although it isn't impossible, my family would have a much easier life in a country they are familiar with, rather than move to an entirely new place and have to cope with the culture shock of America.\n\nBesides comparative benefits, working as an engineer has positive results as well, especially nationalism.  The Communists, which have control of all of China, are promising to rebuild and modernize China, and working for them would mean that my family gets to contribute to making China great again, something that would be very unlikely with the Guomindang, given its inability to control territory on the mainland.  Working with the Communist government, would be, in effect, working for the Chinese people to bring out country into the modern era.  Engineers are very important for building China's infrastructure, and without engineers, it would be impossible to build the roads, factories, and mines necessary for China's industrialization.  This industrialization will be critical to building up both China's economy and China's military.  These factors are critical to make China an important actor in the international arena.  Without engineers like those in my family, China will not be able to compete with nations like Japan and the United States in the future, which will only cause more imperialism, suffering and shame within China.  \n\nFinancial compensation with the Communist party would also be greater than it would with the Guomindang.  With Communist control of the tax base, they have much more money to spend than the Guomindang, and can afford to pay more.  Furthermore, since engineers are so important to the government, the Communists are paying very high salaries to engineers working for the party.  Engineering jobs within the Communist Party also offer many opportunities to advance in position.  Many new higher positions are being taken up by engineers advising the Communists about how to proceed with their extensive industrializing and modernizing processes.  \n\nThis situation would be different if we owned large silk factories.  Since the Communists have nationalized many of the industries, including silk factories, which would reduce much of the family's wealth.  Without this source of wealth, it would probably be better to work either in the United States, or in Taiwan.  \n\n", "section": 4, "uploaded_on": "2008-07-19 20:37:37", "page": "", "priority": 10,
